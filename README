This is a simple drinking game. Juoma means "a drink" in Finnish.

Rules are simple:
  - List players
  - List available drinks
  - The person with the highest number has to drink the drink provided by the game,
      player can decide portion size
  - If you puke or pass out, you lose
  - If a drink runs out, it must be removed from the drink list
  - Last one who's not thrown up or passed out, IS THE WINNER!
  - Do not die
  - Have fun
